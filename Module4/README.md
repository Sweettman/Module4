# Overview

This is my MODULE #4, The goal was to have two Arduino microcontrollers communicate with eachother
wirelessly. To acumplish this we used radio communications; we used two transceiver devices
one as TX(transmiter) and the other RX(receiver). For this module, we wanted TX to have 
buttons that when pressed, it would send a signal to the RX that would then turn on 
the greed LED.
